## My process

This time I added a custom animation for the hover effect. Animations are very fun to buid, and it was a great oportunity to use loops and mixins.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass â™¥
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

With this project I discovered a new CSS property: `clip-path`. I also learned how to use loops in Sass.
